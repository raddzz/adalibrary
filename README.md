# AdaLibary

AdaLibrary is a project I started to make a lightweight system for dealing with a small library.

The project sends reminder emails when a book is due in, as well as logging lends and returns, and all the books in the system.

Book information is taken from the Google Books service.

## Installation

Download or clone the repo

Use install.sql into a mysql database

Configure the Google Books API Key, database and email (currently gmail only) in config.php
